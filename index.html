            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Matt. I'm 25 years old living in Victoria, BC, Canada. I'm currently studying with Codecademy to enhance my skills as a web developer. I studied Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire in England and obtained a diploma of higher education in 2018. My main hobby is football, also known as soccer in this part of the world. I regularly wake up at 6am to watch my team lose more often than not and I'd never change it for the world! As they say, you can change your friends, change your wife but you can never change your football team.</p>
